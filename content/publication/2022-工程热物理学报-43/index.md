abstract: The use of Additive Manufacturing (AM) based on metal powder has been rapidly
applied in the fields of aerospace, new energy and new materials, but its product performance is
limited by the quality of the powder layer formed during the spreading process. Based on the
realistic physical and mechanical properties of an individual particle in the metal powder, the blade
spreading process in additive manufacturing is simulated in this work by discrete element method.
The results show that the total volume of particles in the spread layer is linear to the spreading gap,
and the critical spreading gap size is the number based D90. Meanwhile, empty patches could be
found in the spread layer along the spreading direction, and the number of empty patches decreases
with its length in an exponential law while the size of empty patches is sensitive to the gap size.
Particle jamming could occur at the spreading gap, and its probability decreases sharply with the
survival time. The jamming event with longer survival time has more effects on the formation of
empty patches in the spread layer. During the survival period of particle jamming in the spreading
direction, large force of the contact pair is generated, and then the empty patches in the spread layer
is formed through the burst process of particles.
