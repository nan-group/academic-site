abstract = {We simulated the cohesive particle flow in an impeller-based rheometer using Discrete Element Method (DEM), and we focus on the dynamics of particles around the constriction between the blade and its surrounding vessel wall. The results show that mechanical jamming could transiently and intermittently occur in the constriction, but it is limited in a narrow region and short duration. Larger stiffness of particles and lifting flow pattern are more prone to the occurrence of jamming. The scaling law used to speed up the DEM simulation by reducing particle stiffness may fail for particle flow passing through clearance. The mechanical jamming of particles is in low frequency with value <50 Hz and the duration of an individual jamming event is usually <0.04 s. The existence of mechanical jamming is also illustrated by the experiment, where the wear of particle surface is clearly observed with scratches and pits.}
